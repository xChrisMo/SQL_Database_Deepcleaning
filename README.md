# Udiddit Database Deepcleaning

## 'Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator' schema design project from Udacity's SQL Nanodegree program

The project involves investigating a poorly designed database for Udiddit, making new tables using DDL and DCL commands that enforce the newly required schema, and then migrating data to meet new business needs using DML commands.
